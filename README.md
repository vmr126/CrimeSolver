Clearance rates 

In the United States, homicide clearance rates vary among jurisdictions. A clearance rate is the ratio of solved crimes to unsolved ones. Richmond, VA, for example, clears approximately 74% of homicides, while Chicago clears fewer than 30%. Cities with low clearance rates pose a greater risk to innocent citizens while also denying victims and their families justice.

This study seeks to investigate quantitative and qualitative characteristics associated with whether a murder is cleared by using classification methods of statistical learning. Among these predictors are the percentage of racial minorities in a county, victim characteristics, such as race, and murder weapon used. If Hispanic victims in counties that have a population with a high percentage of white individuals are going unsolved, then we would expect there to be a relationship between race and whether or not a case is solved.
